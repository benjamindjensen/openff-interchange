Hierarchy is
1. Match molceules with preset charges
2. Match chemical environment against library charges
3. Match chemical environment against charge increments
4. Run AM1-BCC (or a variant) on remaining molecules

Test cases

* Ligands get AM1-BCC

4. ff14SB with Sage

7. Sage with preset charges on ligand A

8. Sage with preset charges on water

9. Sage with (ligand) virtual site parameters
* Water gets preset charges
* Ions get library charges
* Non-water solvent gets AM1-BCC
* Ligand heavy atoms get AM1-BCC and charge increments
* Virtual sites get charge increments

10. AM1-with-custom-BCCs Sage with ligand and ions water
* Water gets library charges
* Ions get library charges
* Ligand gets charge increments

Other details
* Specifics of charge method (AM1-BCC, AM1-BCC-ELF10, AM1-BCC via NAGL)
* Molecules with preset charges can be similar but not exact enough
* Preset charges and virtual sites is underspecified and cannot be tested
